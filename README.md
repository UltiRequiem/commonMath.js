The idea of this project is to make a web application that has a wide
variety of mathematical operations available, easy to use for the end user.

The problem is that I still do not feel comfortable working with CSS or 
making user interfaces so the appearance of the page does not look pretty
and it is not easy to use.

At this moment I am trying to become as familiar as possible with the world of
the web development, probably in a couple of months I will resume this project
with more knowledge of UI, UX and CSS.
